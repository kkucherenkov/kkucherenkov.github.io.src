Summary: Short explanation why I start this blog

Few days age I've seen a speech of Chiu-Ki Chan on Droidcon Boston 2017: How to be an Android Expert. She said that an expert is a person who happen to be sharing what he knows. And the main idea of whole speech was sharing is the most straight way to become an expert. When you share you gain expertise and you can share more. According to Chiu-Ki it is very nice positive loop. 
Remaining part of the speech was about types, approaches and tips of sharing. For example: use images and code snippets, take part of local meet-ups, use twitter. Also very helpful sample or pet projects on github with corresponding blogposts. 

So I decide to try start sharing and setup blog platform on github pages. There will be articles on following themes: Android development, Kotlin, some electronics projects. And may be something about my other hobbies like D&D or music. Will see!

And also it is language practice =)
